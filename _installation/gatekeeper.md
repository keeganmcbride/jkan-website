In order to authenticate with GitHub securely, you'll need to setup a tiny authentication server called Gatekeeper. Heroku.com provides free server hosting, but you'll need to [create an account](https://signup.heroku.com/) and confirm your email adress. Once you have an account, click the Deploy button below. Pick an `App Name` and fill in your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` then click **Deploy for Free**. Enter the `App Name` you chose below.
